## Introduction
Rivers change from day to day and even hour to hour. The inspiration for this app came from needing to know what's going on with a river in real time. What's the CFS? Has the permiting office closed due to COVID? Is a certain campsite really busy during the summer? The aim was to create a space for people to log in, download a map, and make comments that other users can see for the most up-to-date river information on the web.
